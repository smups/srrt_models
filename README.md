# Slow-roll, (rapid) turn models in two-field inflation
This repository contains the models tested in (ArXiV:2405.11628).

To run the code, the install the latest version of [`inflatox`](https://pypi.org/project/inflatox/)
(for example using `pip install inflatox`). Basic dependencies, like `matplotlib` (*a Â¡recent!
version*), `numpy` and `sympy` are also required to run the code.

## Overview
The code presented here is organised into five python scripts corresponding to the three
tested models and two additional ones. These contain all numerically intensive code. The output of
these scripts is saved to the `out` folder in the root directory.
The jupyter notebook `plots.ipynb` contains all the python plotting code used to make the
figures in (paper).

The trajectories in the trajectories folder have been obtained using `pytransport`
(angular and EGNO models) and `mtransport` (d5 model). This code is not provided in this repository.

## Minimum `inflatox` version
The minimum inflatox version required to run the code here is `v0.7.0`
